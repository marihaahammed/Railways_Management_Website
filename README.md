# db-proj-Bluesky-Railways-2022
Final project completed for Intro to Database system design at Kent State, a team project by Yaseen Shaikh, Mariha Ahammed, Khushi Patel, Brandon Gall, and Jackson Joseph

# Important Notes
The database was developed on Kent State University's dbdev server. To make your own, you can use the file 'setup.py'. However, some tweaking would likely be necessary
Also note that the credentials to get into the database from main.py have been modified for security, so as to not expose my credentials. 
py-flask-branch is the branch that was made into the main branch, and is where the working code is. Other branches were for experimentation purposes, or phased-out implementations (such as php)

We hope you enjoy our work!
